	Epic quote about villains here

The **Demonization** type of [[20 - 29 Power Myths/20 Power Myths/20 Power Myths\|20 Power Myths]] broadly paints particular groups of people in a negative light. The named group may be dangerous, threatening, or merely different. Regardless, they are not to be trusted.

Demonization Myths can usually be identified by an over-generalization of identities that include a diverse range of individual people.

## Dominant Uses

I mean, these generally have a pretty straightforward transition to [[30 - 39 Power Weapons/31 Mythappropriation/31.01 Categorization\|31.01 Categorization]]. It quickly turns everything into a binary, a simplified debate of good vs. evil. It's quite possible you and the demonized group have shared interests, but so long as they aren't aligned with that of the [[40 - 49 Power Actors/40 Power Actors/40 Power Actors\|40 Power Actors]], it's necessary to draw a line between you two.

Demonization Myths play a key role in justifying oppression against minoritized groups. By painting slaves, the poor, or women as subhuman, it makes it easier to stomach policy that takes advantage of them. Such myths may even result is that group's [[30 - 39 Power Weapons/31 Mythappropriation/31.02 Internalization\|31.02 Internalization]] of such thoughts, reducing their likelihood of fighting back.

They are also a common feature of [[30 - 39 Power Weapons/33 Repression/33 Repression\|33 Repression]], serving to stifle or invalidate thought that conflicts with dominant interests. Labor unions, Communists, or even "the Woke" are described as having explicitly *dangerous* ideologies that will threaten your loved ones or your country.

## Examples
### Unworthiness

- Affirmatively Unqualified: The idea that proactive efforts to increase opportunity for disadvantaged groups results in such groups being unfairly boosted. “That black pilot only got his job because of DEI policies!”
- Welfare Queen: The idea that groups supported by state welfare act fraudulently or in otherwise deceptive manners. “That woman is having more children just to get more money from the government!”
- Lazy Immigrant: The idea that foreign groups have not provided valuable contributions to the country. “That Mexican only came to America to leech off benefits!”
- Chosen Poverty: The idea that groups in severe economic conditions made that conscious choice. “That homeless man wouldn’t be on the street if he wasn’t an addict!”
- Model Minority: The idea that “successful” racial groups prove a lack of systemic oppression for others. “Asian Americans must be more hardworking than other races!”   

### Villainous

- Dirty Communist: The idea that proponents of redistributive policies are supporters of authoritarian communist regimes. “Comrade Kamala is going to control the government!"
- Dangerous Terrorist: The idea that groups hold an intrinsically violent disdain for core tenets of American ideology. “Antifa supersoldiers must be stopped!"
- Woke Mob: The idea that
- Crime-Ridden City: The idea that
- Savage Protestor: The idea that

### The Other

- Perpetual Foreigner: The idea that immigrant groups can never fully identify as American, regardless of legal status. “[XXX]”
- Flyover Country: The idea that certain geographic regions are undesirable due to supposedly monolithic populations that inhabit them. “Why would anyone go to Alabama?”
- Polarized Times: The idea that divisive political ideologies prevent connection between opposing

## Response

Honestly, it's probably just best to question broad strokes made of *any* group of people. At the end of the day, individual human beings are complicated. We're all made up of a million different identities, and we're shaped by a billion different cultural and institutional factors. Why does someone act the way they do?

Sure, individuals can do bad things, and they can be held accountable if need be. But if there are *patterns*, some reason that a behavior is happening in multiple people, that begs the question of what systems are producing it? That isn't shifting blame; it's trying to understand.
