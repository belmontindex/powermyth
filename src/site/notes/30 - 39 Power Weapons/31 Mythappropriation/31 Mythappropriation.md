**Mythappropriation** is where things get spicy. 

Okay so imagine everything described in [[20 - 29 Power Myths/20 Power Myths/20 Power Myths\|20 Power Myths]]... and then what if people leverage or redefine those myths for their own purpose. Think of this as the intentional use of the [[10 - 19 Power/12 Permeative Forms\|12 Permeative Forms]] of power.

This is particularly dangerous because it's all the things we take for granted... so we might not even question when it's used.
